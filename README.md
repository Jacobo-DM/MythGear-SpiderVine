# TurtleBack Raft — Seed Packet v0.1
**Name:** TurtleBack Raft with Petal Canopy  
**Concept type:** Modular, low-tech-first floating habitat + learning platform  
**Author / steward (attribution):** JH Durbin (concept & narrative steward)  
**Status:** Concept + field protocol (no deployment implied)
- [Diagram](diagram.html)

## 1) What it is
A **lightly moored, modular raft** designed for:
- **shelter + warmth** (a calm inner dome)
- **rain / sun / wind management** (a steamer-inspired **Petal Canopy** that opens/closes)
- **non-invasive observation + citizen science** (simple instruments + consistent field logs)
- **repairability** (petals, rim modules, and buoyancy segments are removable and replaceable)

This is not a “conquer the sea” build. It is a **gentle, repairable shoreline-in-motion**.

---

## 2) Why it exists
To create a platform that supports:
- **learning by presence** (weather, tide, ecology, systems thinking)
- **restoration-adjacent observation** (without extraction or harm)
- **community-built modules** (open patterns, simple parts, local materials when possible)
- **analog-first measurement** (visible instruments; optional light electronics later)

---

## 3) Prototype 1 scope (keep it simple)
**Prototype 1 = lightly moored + gently movable**
- Sheltered water first (marina basin / protected cove / sanctioned pilot site)
- Focus on: canopy reliability, stability, safety, instrument readability, maintenance workflow

---

## 4) Architecture: three layers
### Layer 1 — The Spine (always stable)
- **TurtleBack Dome:** upper shelter + lower lab/utility (optional wet module later)
- **Equator Ring Beam:** structural seam + mounting collar
- **Instrument Well Module (analog-first):**
  - **Calm Plumb (pendulum-in-tube):** tilt + sea-state signature
  - **Stilling well + float gauge:** readable tide relative to raft

### Layer 2 — Petal Canopy (switches modes)
Steamer-inspired modular petals with a sliding collar actuator (manual winch/rope crank).
- **Open mode:** shade + ventilation + low wind load
- **Closed mode:** storm shell + warmth + protection
- **Petal build:** perforated structural leaf + optional deployable skins (rain catch / shelter / solar thermal)

### Layer 3 — Living Rim (meets the sea)
- **Segmented buoyancy ring** (compliance + repairability; wide ring can be a service track)
- **Nopal deck leaves** (wash-over tolerant; drain slots)
- **Plant modules (“mangrove lattice” behavior):** swappable native trays, no invasives
- **Underbelly cradle:** grids/lattices with breakaway sections (no entanglement nets)

---

## 5) Safety + ethics (non-negotiables)
- **No entanglement design:** avoid nets and long dangling lines; use protected conduits or short, guarded tethers.
- **Breakaway points** for anything that could snag wildlife.
- **Native-only plant modules** and ecological review before installing living components.
- **Removable + reversible:** prototype should be able to leave no trace.
- **Navigation respect:** deploy only with permission and clear marking in appropriate zones.

---

## 6) Measurements (analog-first)
- **Pendulum-in-tube:** not “seafloor truth,” but a visible raft-motion signature (tilt, resonance, mooring jerks).
- **Stilling well float gauge:** tide height relative to the raft, readable in chop.
- Optional later: acoustic depth / pressure / simple data logger—only if needed.

---

## 7) Field protocol
Use: **TurtleBack Field Log v0.1**
- Conditions, canopy mode, tilt maxima, tide readings, mooring notes, ecology observations, maintenance actions.
- Student “Quick Log” included.

---

## 8) Build levels (so teams can choose)
- **Level A — Seed Packet only:** diagrams + log + ethics (this doc)
- **Level B — Mini-prototype:** tabletop/kiddie-pool Petal Canopy + instrument well demo
- **Level C — Marina slip prototype:** sheltered water, lightly moored, supervised sessions
- **Level D — Pilot partnership:** sanctioned ecological/adaptation program collaboration

---

## 9) Who can help (roles needed)
- Small boat / dock hardware builder (mooring + structural pragmatics)
- Fabricator (petal hinges / collar mechanism)
- Marine ecologist / restoration advisor (plant modules + wildlife risk review)
- Education partner (curriculum + stewardship)
- Safety lead (risk register + procedures)

---

## 10) License + stewardship intention
Recommended: **Creative Commons** for documentation (e.g., CC BY-NC-SA) with a clear **no-harm / wildlife-safety** stewardship clause.
Goal: enable community builds while preventing irresponsible deployment.
