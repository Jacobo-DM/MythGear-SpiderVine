SpiderLine (aka SpiderVine) is a human-powered line-access system designed for regenerative work.
It exists in two forms:
1-cable SpiderLine: skill-based, dynamic balance, minimal materials
2-cable SpiderLine: geometry-based stability, higher capacity, repeatable work deployments
SpiderLine pairs naturally with:
The Spoovel — the field “hand” for probing, tending, measuring, placing, retrieving
The Garden Raft — staging + continuity for shoreline / reef / wetland contexts
Spoovel Winch Module (optional) — compact hauling and emergency utility (manual-first)
Design Ethic
Repairable in the field
No single point of failure
Clear training assumptions (no false “easy”)
Safety tether and capture geometry are non-negotiable
Capacity claims always depend on span, sag, anchors, and user training
Status
Concept locked. Blueprints pending. Field notes and safety spec in progress.
