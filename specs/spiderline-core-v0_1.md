# SpiderLine (aka SpiderVine) — Core Spec v0.1

SpiderLine is a human-powered, line-based access and movement system designed for regenerative work in environments where ground disturbance, fuel dependence, or heavy machinery are undesirable.

It prioritizes repairability, embodied skill, and honest physics.

## 1. Canonical Forms

### 1.1 One-Cable SpiderLine (Dynamic Mode)
- Single tensioned cable
- Hanging carriage (pendulum dynamics)
- Stability achieved through rider skill, posture, and braking
- Low material count, high learning curve

**Use cases**
- Short spans
- Training and skill development
- Rapid, minimal deployments

**Notes**
This mode requires active management of momentum and swing. It should never be presented as “easy” or “self-stabilizing.”

---

### 1.2 Two-Cable SpiderLine (Stable Mode)
- Two parallel tensioned cables
- Bridged carriage frame (“sled” geometry)
- Load shared across cables
- Predictable behavior under load

**Use cases**
- Forestry and canopy work
- Camps, crossings, logistics
- Marine and shoreline access when paired with floating platforms

---

## 2. Mechanical Architecture

### 2.1 Carriage Frame
- Rigid rectangular frame
- Designed to bridge one (1-cable) or two (2-cable) lines
- Accepts modular attachments:
  - seat or sling
  - cargo cradle
  - tool rack

### 2.2 Bogie Pattern (Critical for 2-Cable)
Each cable is served by a bogie (wheel set):

- One **fixed bogie**
- One **floating bogie** with limited lateral compliance

This prevents binding and unintended steering when cable tensions are unequal.

---

## 3. Drive (Human-Powered First)
Acceptable drive options include:
- Hand-crank to friction drum contacting cable
- Hand-crank to chain/belt driving a bogie wheel
- Hand-over-hand rope assist (minimal systems)

All drive systems must remain operable without power assist.

---

## 4. Braking Stack (Required)
- **Primary brake:** hand-operated, modulated (bike-style lever)
- **Secondary brake:** rear or foot-actuated (“kickboard-style”) wheel brake
- **Emergency / parking brake:** cable clamp or cam, engaged only at rest or failure

**Design rule:**  
If the rider releases control, the system must slow—not accelerate.

---

## 5. Safety Layer (Non-Negotiable)
- Independent safety tether to cable
- Capture geometry / keeper wheels to prevent derailment
- No single point of failure
- Clearly marked inspection points

---

## 6. Capacity Honesty
Capacity depends on:
- cable rating
- anchor quality
- span length and sag
- user training level

No standalone capacity numbers are valid without these conditions stated.

---

## 7. Companion Systems
SpiderLine is designed to integrate with:
- The Spoovel (field interface tool)
- Garden Raft or other floating staging platforms
- Spoovel Winch Module (optional)

---

## Status
Concept locked.  
Blueprints pending.  
Field testing required before load claims.
