# Spoovel Winch Module — Spec v0.1

The Spoovel Winch Module is an optional, manual-first attachment that turns the Spoovel into a compact hauling, redirect, and retrieval tool.

It is not the identity of the Spoovel, but a force-multiplying accessory.

---

## 1. Purpose (Tight Scope)

The winch exists to:
- Assist controlled lifting and lowering
- Act as a portable pulley / redirect point
- Support emergency stabilization and retrieval
- Enable safer marine waste collection and handling
- Assist with line tensioning and adjustment for SpiderLine

It is not intended for:
- High-speed hauling
- Unrated life-safety lifts
- Continuous industrial use

---

## 2. Design Principles
- Manual-first operation
- Field-repairable components
- Clear load ratings
- Obvious failure modes
- Minimal moving parts

---

## 3. Mounting Concept
- Winch mounts to Spoovel shaft or reinforced shoulder bracket
- Rope routes through a fairlead aligned with Spoovel axis
- Mount must resist torsion without compromising Spoovel handling

---

## 4. Operating Modes

### 4.1 Hoist Mode
- Controlled lifting of loads (waste bags, sample buckets, tools)
- Used with stable footing or SpiderLine suspension

### 4.2 Redirect Mode
- Spoovel used as a temporary anchor / fairlead
- Enables mechanical advantage systems (2:1, 3:1)

### 4.3 Tension Mode
- Assists in setting or adjusting SpiderLine tension
- Fine control, not brute force

---

## 5. Safety Notes (Mandatory)
- Load rating must be clearly labeled
- Gloves recommended at all times
- Pinch points must be visible and guarded where possible
- Winch is never the sole life-safety system unless explicitly engineered and certified for that use

## Status
Concept defined.  
Engineering details pending.  
Field testing required before deployment in rescue contexts.
