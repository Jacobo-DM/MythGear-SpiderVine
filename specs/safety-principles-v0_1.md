# SpiderLine & Spoovel — Safety Principles v0.1

This document defines baseline safety assumptions for all SpiderLine and Spoovel systems.

It is intentionally conservative.

---

## 1. Philosophy
- Gravity is always active
- Human error is expected
- Systems must fail visibly and slowly where possible
- Skill does not replace redundancy

---

## 2. Non-Negotiables
- Independent safety tether for any suspended person
- Capture geometry to prevent derailment
- No single point of failure
- Visual inspection before each use

---

## 3. Training Assumptions
- One-cable SpiderLine requires explicit training
- Two-cable SpiderLine reduces, but does not remove, risk
- Users must be taught braking dynamics before load carrying

---

## 4. Environmental Awareness
- Wet, salty, sandy, or icy conditions change braking behavior
- Marine environments accelerate corrosion and wear
- Debris can alter wheel and brake performance

---

## 5. Load Discipline
- Never exceed the lowest-rated component
- Dynamic loads exceed static estimates
- When in doubt, reduce load or increase mechanical advantage

---

## 6. Emergency Bias
- Systems should default to slowing, not speeding
- Parking brakes should hold without continuous effort
- Clear verbal and visual communication is required during lifts

---

## 7. Ethical Boundary
SpiderLine and Spoovel are regenerative tools.
They are not weapons, intimidation devices, or surveillance platforms.

## Status
Living document.  
Revised with each field iteration.
